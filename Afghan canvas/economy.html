        <img src="Eco3.jpg" class="img-fluid cover-content-img" alt="...">
          <div class="general-content-text">
            <p>The economy of Afghanistan ranks 124th in the world based on nominal GDP and 102nd based on PPP. With a population of around 41 million, Afghanistan's GDP in 2021 is $14.58 billion, resulting in a GDP per capita of $363.7. The country's annual exports exceed $2 billion, primarily consisting of agricultural, mineral, and textile products. Afghanistan's total external debt stands at $1.4 billion as of 2022.
             The Afghan economy has seen improvements due to the influx of expatriates, the establishment of additional trade routes with neighboring and regional countries, and the growth of agriculture, energy, and mining sectors. Assistance from expats and the international community, along with political stability after NATO's involvement, has contributed to this progress.
             Despite having vast untapped mineral deposits worth over one trillion dollars, Afghanistan remains one of the least developed countries globally. The country faces challenges such as an unemployment rate of over 23% and approximately half of the population living below the poverty line. The continuous war has deterred business investors and hindered economic development. Afghanistan has actively sought foreign investment to improve its economy. The population of Afghanistan has increased by more than 50% between 2001 and 2014, while the GDP has grown eightfold.
             After the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban's return to power in 2021, the Biden administration decided to confiscate or withhold $9.5 billion worth of assets from the Afghanistan Central Bank to prevent the Taliban from accessing them.
            The official currency of Afghanistan is the Afghani (AFN), with an exchange rate of approximately 70 Afghanis to 1 United States dollar. The country has a central bank called Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), and several local banks operate within Afghanistan, including the Afghanistan International Bank, Azizi Bank, New Kabul Bank, and Pashtany Bank.

      <section class="container">
        <h3 class="headers-deco">Economy Sectors</h3>
        <div class="Specific-content-text bg-dark">
            <h4 class="headers-deco">Agriculture and livestock</h4>
            <img src="Eco4.png" class="img-fluid general-content-img" alt="...">
            <p>Agriculture remains Afghanistan’s most important source of employment: 60-80 percent of Afghanistan’s population works in this sector, although it accounts for less than a third of GDP due to insufficient irrigation, drought, lack of market access, and other structural impediments. Most Afghan farmers are primarily subsistence farmers. 
              According to the United Nations, nine out of 10 people in Afghanistan do not have enough food to eat, and extreme poverty is near-universal. Agriculture remains the backbone of Afghanistan’s economy. “Despite a decline in its share of Afghanistan’s overall economy, the sector still employs 40 percent of the total workforce, and more than half of Afghans living in rural areas contribute to agriculture. With the right mix of policies and investments, the agriculture sector can drive down poverty and boost sustained growth in Afghanistan through jobs, better productivity, and inclusiveness.
              Afghanistan’s rural economy is experiencing an influx of youth workers into the labor force, increasing the competition for every new job. The rural economy, however, is not yet equipped to absorb all workers into the labor market. As a result, more than 50 percent of rural youth workers are involved in agriculture and livestock, mostly as unpaid family workers. 
              The female labor force participation rate (women who work for paid income) in rural areas continues to be low at 29 percent, with 60 percent of employed women working in the livestock sector. Four out of five female rural workers are unpaid family workers, compared with only one out of five male workers.
              The low share of agricultural income, despite the high employment share, is mainly due to limited market participation and the high number of unpaid family workers. Few rural households that own garden plots or raise livestock sell at the market to earn income. Youth and women constitute a large portion of this unpaid workforce.” (The World Bank, 2018)<br>
              Livestock farming in Afghanistan primarily involves cattle, sheep, and goats. Poultry farming is widespread in the warmer regions, and the Habib Hassam Poultry Complex is located in Jalalabad.

            <h5 class="headers-deco">Products</h5>
            <img src="Eco5.jpg" class="img-fluid general-content-img" alt="...">
            <p>Afghanistan is known for its production of high-quality fruits, including pomegranates, grapes, melons, mulberries, apples, apricots, cherries, figs, kiwi, oranges, peaches, pears, persimmons, plums, and strawberries. The country's agricultural sector has seen an increase in the number of farms, and the cultivation of vegetables in greenhouses is expanding. Pistachios are traditionally grown in the northern and western provinces, while American pistachio trees are now being cultivated in the southern provinces. 
            Pine nuts are famous in the eastern provinces, and almonds and walnuts are grown in the northern and central regions. Potatoes, citrus fruits, olives, peanuts, and dates are produced in various provinces, and the cultivation of avocados, bananas, and pineapples has started in certain areas. Afghanistan ranks 54th in vegetable production, with a focus on domestic consumption, including beans, cabbages, carrots, corn, cucumbers, eggplants, lettuce, onions, peppers, potatoes, pumpkins, spinach, tomatoes, turnips, and zucchinis. 
            Wheat and cereal production are crucial for the country, and Afghanistan is nearing self-sufficiency in grain production, requiring an additional 1 to 3 million tons of wheat to achieve this goal shortly. The country has over 7.5 million hectares of arable land. In 2015, wheat production reached approximately 5 million tons. Nurseries are occupying 119,000 hectares of land, and grape production amounts to 615,000 tons. Cotton production has surged to 500,000 tons. Saffron cultivation covers around 3,200 hectares of farmland, mainly in the western, northern, and southern regions of the country. Asafetida is grown on nearly 980 hectares of land.</p>
            <h6 class="headers-deco">Saffron</h6>
            <img src="Eco6.jpg" class="img-fluid general-content-img" alt="...">
            <p>“Saffron cultivated and produced in Afghanistan has been recognized as the best in the world in terms of its quality for the eighth consecutive year, a member of the Saffron Producers Union in Kabul said.
             According to the union, the quality and taste of the Afghan saffron were evaluated at an institution in Belgium.
            “Every year, there is an improvement in saffron cultivation and production, and this improves the quality of our saffron,” said Bashir Ahmad Rashidi, head of the union.
             Figures by the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock show that Afghanistan provides 8.15 tons (6.3%) of the world's global saffron consumption, which is 430 tons a year.
             The figure also shows that Afghanistan produced 8.15 tons of saffron last year, bringing it into third place after Iran and India.
             “A big part of the saffron production was tested in our standard laboratories for its quality and we found that the quality of the saffron is the best based on international standards and of course it is the best in the world in terms of its quality and form,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Akbar Rustami, said.
             According to the Agriculture Ministry, the price for each kilogram of saffron in local markets is up to Afs90, 000 ($1,145) and it is above $1,400 in international markets.” (Zabihullah Jahanmal, Tolo News Reporter, 2019)

            <h4 class="headers-deco">Forestry</h4>
            <p>According to a 2010 report, only about 2.1% (or 1,350,000 ha (3,300,000 acres)) of Afghanistan is forested. This can be significantly increased by planting trees, including in the non-rocky hills and mountains which trap underground water. Some steps have been taken in recent years to plant trees in urban areas all across Afghanistan. 
            Even the Taliban spiritual leader has recently called for planting more trees. Felling has been made illegal nationally.</p>

            <h4 class="headers-deco">Trade and Industry</h4>
            <p>Afghanistan's strategic geographical location provides economic opportunities through trade routes and access to international airports and seaports. The country is connected to neighboring countries like Turkmenistan, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan through trade routes, and it has direct trade links with China and India. Afghanistan has international airports in Kabul, Mazar-e Sharif, Herat, and Kandahar, facilitating air trade. The national rail network is expanding to connect Central Asia with Pakistan and Iran, and goods are imported by rail from Iran and China. The country has numerous official border crossing points and legal access to major seaports in Pakistan and Iran.
            Afghanistan possesses abundant natural resources, including deposits of barites, chromite, coal, copper, gold, iron ore, lead, lithium, marble, natural gas, petroleum, gemstones, salt, sulfur, talc, and zinc. There are also significant deposits of rare-earth elements and colored stones, such as emerald, ruby, sapphire, and lapis lazuli. These untapped mineral resources are estimated to be worth at least $1 trillion, and some believe their value could reach up to $3 trillion. Afghanistan has mining agreements with China for copper and has significant copper and iron reserves. It has also explored contracts for gold mining and has coal mines. The country has historically relied on natural gas exports, and efforts have been made to restore and increase gas production. Additionally, Afghanistan has signed contracts with China and other companies for oil extraction, aiming to become self-sufficient in oil production by 2026.
            Overall, Afghanistan's geographical position, trade connections, and substantial natural resources present opportunities for economic development and self-sufficiency in various sectors, including agriculture, mining, and energy.

            <h5 class="headers-deco">Carpet Industry</h5>
            <img src="Eco7.jpeg" class="img-fluid general-content-img" alt="...">
            <p>“The Afghan carpet industry employs more than 1 million people, about 3% of the population. Millions more work in related industries, such as wool production, cutting, washing and design. Because these dominant industries have significant growth and export potential, the carpet sector has become a major focus for Afghanistan's government and private-sector support organizations. 
             In 2005, Afghanistan sold abroad $140 million worth of carpets, its largest official export. If the country could repatriate the portion of its carpet industry that has migrated to Pakistan, the size of the industry would double, according to a study commissioned by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Projected to grow 11% a year, Afghan carpet exports could reach $350 million by 2015, according to the study.
             For centuries, Afghanistan was recognized as a global leader in carpet production. But after the Taliban took power, many Afghan carpet makers fled to Pakistan. Since the Taliban were defeated in 2001, some 60% of the carpet makers who fled have returned to their homeland and are producing goods of exquisite beauty.
             A recent article published by a newspaper in Pittsburgh described how Afghan women weavers are channeling their artistic talents into carpets because weaving is one of their few outlets for expression. The article described one woman weaver who created the design of a falling leaf to symbolize her loss of a child.” (Afghanistan Carpet Industry Revitalizes, Floor Daily, November 2023)
             “KABUL: Afghanistan is planning to boost carpet production throughout the country, its Ministry of Industry and Commerce said on Tuesday, with targets to employ 1.5 million people in the sector to meet rising demand, especially from China.
             Afghan rugs are known for their quality and craftsmanship, but demand has taken a sharp dip since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 and with the nation’s economy teetering on the brink of collapse.
             In 2022, the Afghan carpet industry made “a great achievement” as exports reached $20 million, with production taking place in 18 provinces and the sector employing more than 1 million people, ministry spokesman Abdul Salam Jawad told Arab News.
             “Last year, the export of carpets through the ports of different provinces of Afghanistan was very great,” Jawad said. “The plan is to start sewing carpets throughout the country this year.””(Afghanistan to boost carpet production as demand rises, especially from China, Arab News, November 2023)
            </p>
            <h4 class="headers-deco">Tourism</h4>
            <p>Tourism in Afghanistan was at its peak in 1977. Many tourists from around the world visited Afghanistan, including from as far away as Europe and North America. All of that ended with the start of the April 1978 Saur Revolution. However, it is again gradually increasing despite having reputation as one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Between 4,000 and 20,000 foreign tourists visit Afghanistan every year. As many as 371,000 Afghans have visited different parts of the country in 2022. Tourists are advised to avoid areas where armed criminals may operate.
            The city of Kabul has many guest houses and hotels, which include the Kabul Serena Hotel, the Hotel Inter-Continental Kabul, the Safi Landmark Hotel, and the Kabul Star Hotel. A small number of guest houses and hotels are also available in other cities such as Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, Jalalabad, Bamyan, Fayezabad, etc. For those wanting to travel by road, there are bus terminals with mosques, Afghan-style restaurants, and small shops in the major cities.
            <br>The following are some of the notable places in Afghanistan that tourists visit:
            <ul>
                <li>Wakhan National Park in Wakhan District, Badakhshan Province</li>

        <h3 class="headers-deco">Conclusion</h3>
        <div class="general-content-text"> 
          <p>Afghanistan's economy has undergone significant transformations in recent years, facing both challenges and opportunities. The country's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, services, and natural resources. However, due to decades of conflict and political instability, Afghanistan's economic development has been hindered.
            One of the key sectors of Afghanistan's economy is agriculture, which plays a vital role in the livelihoods of the Afghan population. The country is known for its production of fruits, nuts, and other agricultural products. However, the agricultural sector faces challenges such as limited access to irrigation, infrastructure, and modern farming techniques. 
            Another important sector is services, which includes trade, transportation, telecommunications, and finance. Services contribute to the overall growth of the economy and provide employment opportunities. Efforts to improve infrastructure and expand access to financial services have been made to support the development of this sector.
            In conclusion, Afghanistan's economy is characterized by its reliance on agriculture, the growth of its services sector, and the potential of its natural resources. Despite the challenges posed by conflict, security issues, and limited infrastructure, there are opportunities for economic development and diversification. Addressing these challenges and investing in key sectors can contribute to sustainable economic growth, job creation, and improved living standards for the people of Afghanistan.
